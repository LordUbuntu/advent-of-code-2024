# PART 1 - 
# So far the problem seems pretty simple. I need to implement a DFS that
#   starts on any X and goes in one of the 8 grid directions. If it finds
#   the letters "XMAS" in that order, then after fully exploring that X
#   mark it as done and move on to the next one. X's are chosen by simply
#   scanning across the grid.
